## 🔴About
Lightning boy remains as my first simple game, inspired by Super Mario Bros where you gotta jump and avoid obstacle in order to reach to your winning places. I built the player movement system, Climbing System, Healthcontroller and the kill system for the player when falling to lava or touch nearby obstacle.
